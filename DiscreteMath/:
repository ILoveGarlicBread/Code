* Trees and Applications
** Applications
   - Binary search trees (Huffman code)
   - Balanced trees (AVL trees)
   - Parse trees (Matrix-tree theorem)
   - Spanning trees
   - Decision trees
   - Labeled trees
** Definition
   A simple undirected graph is called a tree if it is connected & acyclic (no cycle).
   A leaf is a vertex of degree 1.
   A node not a leaf is called an internal node.
*** Theorem 
    Tree $T=(V,E)$ be a tree: 
    Then T has at least 1 leaf.
    Removing a leaf from a tree yields a tree.
