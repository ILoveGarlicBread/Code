# 5.1 
## a)
is valid, because all are negative and sum up to 1.
## b)
0.65

# 5.2
# a)
4 or five
# b) 
Mean for executives is 4.05
variance = 1.2475
Mean for Managers is 3.84
variance = 1.1344
# c) 
standard deviation:
executives is 1.12
manager is 1.07

# 5.3 
## a) 
yes, because there are 10 trials
two outcomes, higher or lower than 7000 dollars for students' balance
trials are independent, picking a student does not affect the out come of another trial 
probability is the same for each trial: 9%

## b) 
using the formula: 
with n = 10 
x = 2 and p = 0.09
P(x = 2 ) = C(10,2)*0.09^2 *(0.91)^8 = 0.283

## c) 
same formular = 0.389
## d) 
calculate the probability of 3 and less student that 
has balance greater than 7000
then 1 - P(X<3)
is around 0.054

# 5.4
n = 15 
x = 4 and p = 0.28
P(X = 4 ) = C(15,4)*(0.28)^4 * (0.72)^11 
result is 0.23
