# 10.1 
## a) 
Null Hypothesis: u <= 14
Alternative Hypothesis: u > 14
This is a one tailed test because the manager wants to see whether the sale increase or not.
## b)
if H_0 can't be rejected: 
+ not enough evidence that the new plan increase the sale
+ new plan is ineffective, or there is no difference with the old plan
## c) 
if H_0 can be rejected: 
+ Enough proof that the new plan does increase the sale
+ The manager can consider having the new plan for all sale employee instead of a sample.

# 10.2
This is a one tailed test
standard deviation is unknown, so use z statistic
z-score critical is 1.645
reject H0 if z > 1.645
don't reject H0 if z <= 1.645
## a) 
sample mean = 52.7 
z-score = 2.61 > 1.645, so reject H0
Population mean is greater than 50
## b) 
sample mean = 51 
z-score = 0.97 < 1.645, so don't reject H0
can't conclude that population mean is greater than 50
## c) 
sample mean = 51.8
z-score = 1.74 > 1.645, reject H0
Population mean is greater than 50

# 10.3
Null Hypothesis: u <= 47.50
Alternative Hypothesis: u > 47.50
This is a one-tailed test
standard deviation is unknown, so use t statistic
critical t value = 1.670
t value is 2.33 > critical t
so reject H0
not enough evidence to conclude that Atlanta consumers pay 
above-average rates for water provided by private companies.
