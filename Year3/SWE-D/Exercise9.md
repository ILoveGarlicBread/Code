1. 
The number of defects remaining in a program at the time of delivery can affect product support.
Higher defects lead to increased support requirements, while fewer defects result in better product support.

2.
Pros:
Immediate feedback, quicker fixes
Accountability, having to test your own code makes you pay more attention to quality
Cost, don't have to hire testers
Detect bugs earlier while in development
Better documentation

Cons:
Conflict of interest
Might overlook obvious bugs
Test under ideal conditions, won't see unexpected scenario
Distract from actual development
Incomplete test coverage

4.
Regression testing is a type of software testing that ensures
that recent changes to a program or system do not negatively impact existing functionality.

5. 
Black-box testing, sometimes referred to as specification-based testing,
is a method of software testing that examines the functionality of an application
without peering into its internal structures or workings.

White box testing is a software testing method where the tester has access to the
internal structure and code of the application being tested
