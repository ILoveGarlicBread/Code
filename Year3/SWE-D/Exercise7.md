Mainframe is centralized hardware, Cloud is distributed, virtualized server
With main frame the costs of setting up and maintaining are high, and hard to scale
With cloud you only pay the provider for the usage of the infrastructure that are already in place,
and it is easier to scale up or down.

My implementation runs locally, resources are limited to my laptop hardware, for it to scale I would need to redesign
With cloud the amount of website that can be monitored would be way more than my laptop can ever handled, and the resources
would be dynamically scaled.
There's also differences in security, access, and fault tolerance.
